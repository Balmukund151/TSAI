Convolution:- Pulling out information by applying different filter on an image is convolution  
Filters/Kernels:- Filter are the matrices which when applied to an area of image helps in taking out a feature from image.  
Epochs:- If we go through the full set of all the images provided, then it is said to have completed one Epoch.  
1x1 Convolution:-  1x1 convolution filters are used to reduce/increase the no. of channels keeping the input shape the same.  
3x3 Convolution:- This filter is the best filter which when applied reduces the input shape by 2 units.  
Feature Maps:- The output of applying filter over a image is the feature map.  
Activation Function:- It predits whether the input is of the given type or not by providing the numerical values on it.  
Receptive Field:- The no. of units of an image that is visible to a feature map is referred to its receptive field.
